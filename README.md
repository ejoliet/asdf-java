# asdf-java
The **A**dvanced **S**cientific **D**ata **F**ormat (ASDF) is a
next-generation interchange format for scientific data. This repository
contains a prototype library implementation of the [ASDF Standard](https://asdf-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in Java. It is not meant to be feature-complete, but it should supports ASDF's core capabilities of storing metadata in YAML and serializing n-dimensional numerical data arrays.
